How to use:

✔️ Enter a Youtube link for a dance you want to learn

✔️ There will be the option to mirror / fullscreen the video, as well as to trim a certain section and loop it!

What's next:

⭐ Add the option to upload MP4 files to learn from, for when Youtube links don't work

⭐ Improve the Comparison Tool to start both videos at the same time

⭐ Add more speed options (ex. slider for 0.25x ---> 1.0x)
